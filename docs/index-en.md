Due to the availability of multiple and large-scale datasets, diverse and complex data analysis tools and pipelines, reproducing computational experiments is becoming more and more challenging [[Alsheikh-Ali *et al*. 2011](https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0024357), [Nekrutenko & Taylor, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fnrg3305)]. 

[ReProVirtuFlow](https://www.madics.fr/actions/actions-en-cours/reprovirtuflow) is a research group from [GDR MaDICS](https://www.madics.fr) aiming at providing a state-of-the-art on reproducibility-oriented approaches considering as promising directions (i) scientific workflows (ii) provenance, and (iii) virtualized computing environments (virtual machines and containers). Technical coordinators of data analysis and management facilities (CNRS INSB and IN2P3) as well as experts in computer science form part of the ReProVirtuFlow consortium. 

# ReproHackathons
As part of our activities, we are organizing reproducibility-oriented hackathons aimed at testing workflow management systems in realistic conditions to reproduce scientific experiments.  

Each ReproHackathon will provide to participants : 
* access to the [IFB Cloud infrastructure](http://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/en/cloud),
* use cases based on academic papers: for each use case, an input dataset as well as a data analysis pipeline will be provided . The challenge will consist in reproducing the published results.

Participants are encouraged to form teams and select 
* one of the proposed use cases ;
* a workflow management system to implement the data analysis pipeline and try to obtain the expected results. 

## ReproHackathons, first edition

The first ReproHackathon will take place in [Gif-sur-Yvette](https://goo.gl/maps/ceg55oQTD6E2) the 1st and 2nd of June 2017. 

[Two use cases](Hackathon_1-en.md) have been selected:
* RNA-Seq patient data analysis in the context of uveal melanoma ;
* Phylogenetics data analysis and simulation. 

Due to logistic constraints, **the number of participants is limited to 20**. When registering to the ReproHackathon event, you engage yourself to participate and contribute as a developer. A feedback event will be later on organized. 

*The first ReproHackathon is supported by [GDR MaDICS](https://www.madics.fr) and Psay CompBio of Universit√© Paris-Saclay*
